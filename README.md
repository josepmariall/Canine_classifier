# Building Canine classifier
The goal of this project is to create an algoirthm that recognizes humans and dogs. If a man is detected, it will predict the 
dogg breed that most ressembles the human in the picture. If a dog is detected, it will predict its most likely dog breed. 
This project is done from a Udacity project. 

## About this project 
The goal of this project is to create an algoirthm that recognizes humans and dogs. If a man is detected, it will predict the 
dogg breed that most ressembles the human in the picture. If a dog is detected, it will predict its most likely dog breed. 

To do so, I have created different files. 
Initially, there's some data visualization. Then there's an attempt to create an image classifier from scratch. Then, state-of-the-art
models are used (transfer learning) to obtain better results. Initially, the first model tested is DENSENT 161, and later VGG16.

Finally, using VGG16 and a human detector, an algorithm is created to detect humans and dogs.

## Install
I provide the [environment](https://github.com/titoniubo/Canine_classifier/blob/master/deeplearning.yml) used to run this code.
