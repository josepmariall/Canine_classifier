# Building Canine classifier
The goal of this project is to create an algoirthm that recognizes humans and dogs. If a man is detected, it will predict the 
dogg breed that most ressembles the human in the picture. If a dog is detected, it will predict its most likely dog breed. 
This project is done from a Udacity project. 

## Install
I provide the [environment](https://github.com/titoniubo/Canine_classifier/blob/master/cnn_environment.yml) used to run this code.

## About this project 
The goal of this project is to create an algoirthm that recognizes humans and dogs. If a man is detected, it will predict the 
dogg breed that most ressembles the human in the picture. If a dog is detected, it will predict its most likely dog breed. 

To do so, I have created different files. 
Initially, there's some data visualization. Then there's an attempt to create an image classifier from scratch. Then, state-of-the-art
models are used (transfer learning) to obtain better results. Initially, the first model tested is DENSENT 161, and later VGG16.

Finally, using VGG16 and a human detector, an algorithm is created to detect humans and dogs.


### Code of ethics
I, a Data practitioner, will promote the well-being of others and myself while striving to do no harm with data through:
1. Professional application of analytical techniques
2. Humility in analytic claims
3. Anticipation of legal and regulatory scenarios
4. Transparency in computation and documentation
5. Fidelity to this oath beyond bottom line
